"It is said that long before Men ever came from the west to settle the "
"continent, in the days when even the elves and dwarves were new to the "
"world, the dwarves had a great city nestled high in the remote mountain "
"peaks. Here in their ancestral homeland the ancient dwarves were said to "
"possess spectacular riches; it was said that every wall in the city was "
"forged of gold and silver and studded with precious jewels. But even the "
"Gods were jealous of their wealth, according to the myths, and so the city "
"was cast down and the dwarves scattered across the continent."

"rumors of the long-forgotten Valley of the Ancients, seeking to plunder the "
"lost wonders of the dwarves. Most disappear and are never heard from again, "
"and some speculate that they did indeed find the Valley... and succumbed to "
